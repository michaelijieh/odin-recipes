# odin-recipes
This is my first project following the curriculum of Odin Project. 
The project will deliver a recipe website. An actual basic website simply using HTML and CSS. At the end I should be able to show competency and understanding of tags, elements, basic structure of a website using HTMl and styling a website using CSS.
